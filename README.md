In the `User Preferences` window go to the `Add-ons` tab and start searching for `Arctic Beard Studio Toolkit`. <br/>
The add-on should now appear in the list (and be the only one). All you have to do is check the checkbox, and voila! <br/>
Finally press `Save User Setting` to make sure the add-on is loaded everytime Blender is started. <br/>

NOTE: If Blender was already opened when you cloned the repo you can press `F8` anywhere in Blender to reload all scripts or simply press Refresh in `User Preferences->Add-ons`. This can also be used to reload the add-on if you have updated it. <br/>
